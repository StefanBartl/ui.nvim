---@module 'ui.contextmenu'
--- Building blocks for nvzone/menu-shaped context-menu entries: a
--- self-gating item builder (`entry`/`group`/`submenu`), a renderer
--- (`open`), and a mouse-trigger binder (`bind_buffer`).
---
--- Two renderers draw the same item tables, chosen by `setup{ renderer = … }`:
--- `"nvzone"` (nvzone/menu, the original) and `"kit"`
--- (`ui.kit.menu`, no third-party dependency and themed by the kit).
--- The default `"auto"` prefers nvzone/menu when it is installed and falls
--- back to the kit, so nothing changes for an existing setup. Either way the
--- dependency is soft: `menu` is only `require()`d when a menu actually
--- opens, and a missing install degrades to the kit, never to an error.
---
--- `setup{...}` also turns off Neovim's OWN built-in right-click menu
--- (`:h popup-menu`) by default, which pops up under the editor's default
--- `'mousemodel'` (`popup_setpos`) wherever a click lands on no active
--- `<RightMouse>` mapping at all -- a blank line past a tree's last node,
--- say. From the user's chair that reads as "a different context menu
--- sometimes appears", indistinguishable at a glance from this one
--- degrading. Opt back into vanilla Neovim behaviour with
--- `setup{ native_popup = true }`.
---
--- Two integration shapes this supports (see filetree.nvim and
--- markdown.nvim for the two live reference implementations):
---
--- "Owns its buffer" (a plugin-created UI: a tree, a dashboard, a list-view)
--- >lua
---   -- integrations/menu.lua
---   local nerd = require("lib.nvim.ui.nerd_font")
---
---   function M.items()
---     local out = {}
---     contextmenu.group(out,
---       contextmenu.heading("My Plugin"),
---       contextmenu.entry(feature("x") ~= nil, "Do X", do_x, "<leader>x", {
---         icon = nerd.glyph("F0AD", "*"),
---       })
---     )
---     return out
---   end
---
---   -- features/ui/context_menu/init.lua, on the plugin's own buffer
---   contextmenu.bind_buffer(bufnr, require("myplugin.integrations.menu").items)
--- <
--- "Contributes only" (acts on ordinary filetype-scoped buffers): the plugin
--- ships just `integrations/menu.lua` (`items`/`submenu`) with no trigger
--- code at all; a host (typically the user's own RightMouse dispatcher)
--- composes `submenu(...)` into its own menu for the relevant filetype.

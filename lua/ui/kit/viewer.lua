---@module 'ui.kit.viewer'
--- Viewer component: a read-only, centered info panel — auto-sized to its
--- content, `q`/`<Esc>` closes, and (unlike `note`) closes as soon as focus
--- leaves it. This is the "show some info, dismiss it" float that got
--- hand-rolled independently across consumer plugins: buffer creation,
--- width/height computed from content, centering, `border = rounded`,
--- `q`/`<Esc>` keymap, close-on-WinLeave — six separate times in
--- filetree.nvim alone (node info, cheatsheet, marks, trash history, ...),
--- plus learn-cli.nvim and the nvim-config's own LSP info command.
---
--- Distinct from `note`: `note` is a passive, non-focused notification
--- (`enter = false`, no focus-loss auto-close, optional timeout); `viewer`
--- is meant to be read and possibly scrolled (`enter = true`), and dismisses
--- itself the moment the user's attention moves elsewhere — no timeout,
--- because there's no way to know how long a piece of info takes to read.

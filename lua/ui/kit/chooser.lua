---@module 'ui.kit.chooser'
--- Native themed list chooser. Built on the kit surface; replaces the Phase-2
--- delegation to lib.nvim.ui.hover_select and is a superset of
--- `Lib.HoverSelect.Options`, so hover_select can shim over it with no feature
--- gaps.
---
--- Navigation matches the original hover_select: j/k/arrows move (wrap-around),
--- <CR> selects, <Esc>/q close, h/l (and other horizontal motions) blocked;
--- in multi-select, <Tab>/<S-Tab> toggle. Selection uses the theme's
--- `KitSelection` (current line) and `KitAccent` (marked lines) groups.
---
--- Items are plain strings (one buffer line each) by default, or "rich"
--- tables — `{ lines = {...}, highlights? = {...}, anchor? = 0 }` — for a
--- multi-line entry with per-column highlight groups (see
--- rich items). Navigation moves by logical item,
--- not raw buffer line, so this is transparent to plain-string callers
--- (every item is 1 line, anchor 0 — identical to the old behavior).
---
--- A rich item may set `selectable = false` (separators, headings): the
--- cursor steps over it, <CR> on it is inert, and it can't be marked in
--- multi-select. Plain-string items are always selectable.
---
--- Five presentation options are off by default because they change how the
--- list behaves, not just how it looks, and the chooser is shared by
--- `select`/`picker`/`compare` (see `kit.menu`, which turns all five on):
---
--- - `hide_cursor` — blank the terminal cursor while the list is open, so the
---   highlighted row alone says where you are. `'guicursor'` is global, so it
---   is saved and restored when the list closes for any reason.
--- - `single_click` — one left click picks the row under the pointer, and a
---   click outside the list dismisses it. Without it only `<2-LeftMouse>`
---   selects and a stray click leaves the list open behind the cursor.
--- - `close_on_focus_lost` — dismiss the list when focus moves elsewhere.
---   Wrong for the picker, whose prompt window holds focus by design.
--- - `flash_on_select` — light the picked row for `flash_ms` before the
---   selection is delivered, the way a button acknowledges a press. It has to
---   delay the callback, not run alongside it: a leaf action closes the list,
---   so a flash painted at the same moment is never on screen long enough to
---   see. Off for `select`/`picker`, where the caller may be driving submits
---   programmatically and a deferred callback would change the contract.
--- - `hover` — follow the mouse without a click: whatever row the pointer is
---   over gets the theme's `KitHover` highlight (an extmark of its own, not
---   left to `CursorLine` alone -- see `paint_hover`) and becomes the
---   selection, via `'mousemoveevent'` and the `<MouseMove>` pseudo-key (a
---   silent no-op if that option cannot be set, older than this plugin's own
---   0.10 floor). A terminal grid has no per-pixel blending for text
---   highlights, so this is an instant, unambiguous "this row is hot", not a
---   simulated fade -- the honest equivalent of a button's hover state.

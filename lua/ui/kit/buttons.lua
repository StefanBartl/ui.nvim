---@module 'ui.kit.buttons'
--- Shared button-row helpers: the layout, the focus highlight and the mouse
--- hit-test that `kit.confirm`'s dialog and the button row under a
--- `kit.form`/`kit.input` field (`back = true`) have in common. They used to
--- live inside `kit.confirm`; a second row of `[ Label ]` boxes needing the
--- very same geometry is what made them a module, so that a click lands on
--- exactly the box that is drawn in both places and a change to the box shape
--- cannot be made in one and forgotten in the other.
---
--- Stateless on purpose. The callers are different shapes -- `confirm` is a
--- single-instance module with its own `state`, an input keeps its focus in a
--- closure -- so each keeps its own `labels`/`ranges`/`focus` and hands them
--- in. Nothing here owns a window, a buffer or a keymap.

--- string, so the click target is the visible box and nothing around it.

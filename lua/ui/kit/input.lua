---@module 'ui.kit.input'
--- Input component: a single-line themed prompt (a `vim.ui.input` replacement).
--- Opens focused in insert mode; `<CR>` submits the line, `<Esc>` cancels. It is
--- one line: a newline in `opts.default` (or in a button label) becomes a space.
---
--- `opts.secret = true` masks the displayed content character-by-character
--- via `conceal` (each char replaced with `opts.mask`, default `"*"`) — a
--- `vim.fn.inputsecret` replacement. The mask is re-derived from the actual
--- buffer content on every edit (paste, backspace, mid-line insert all just
--- work, no keystroke-diffing needed) rather than tracked in a shadow
--- variable, so submission still reads the real text straight off the
--- buffer. This only hides the on-screen rendering, matching a terminal
--- password prompt's own echo-suppression rather than the visible-input
--- default; buffer-local `undolevels = -1` additionally keeps the plaintext
--- out of the undo tree. It was never written to disk in the first place —
--- every kit scratch buffer already has `swapfile = false` (make_scratch),
--- and the buffer is wiped when the float closes (`bufhidden = "wipe"`). The
--- Insert run that typed it is also what the `.` register and the redo buffer
--- keep, so once the prompt is gone those are overwritten by an empty run
--- (`M.scrub_insert_traces`); a macro that is being recorded keeps the keys it
--- saw, as it does for `inputsecret()`.
---
--- `opts.completion = "file"` (or any other `getcompletion()` type: "dir",
--- "shellcmd", "buffer", ...) is a `completion = "file"` cmdline-input
--- replacement: `<Tab>` completes the last whitespace-delimited fragment
--- before the cursor via `vim.fn.getcompletion()` and opens Neovim's native
--- completion popup (`vim.fn.complete()`) — real ins-completion, so `<C-n>`/
--- `<C-p>` cycle it same as anywhere else. While the popup is open, `<Tab>`/
--- `<S-Tab>` advance/retreat the selection instead of re-triggering, and
--- `<CR>` accepts the highlighted candidate instead of submitting the whole
--- prompt (a second `<CR>` submits, exactly like confirming a shell
--- completion then pressing enter again). With `"file"` or `"dir"` and more than 300
--- matches the list is built from one directory listing instead (no `stat` per match,
--- sorted, cut to 300): `getcompletion()` took half a second for five thousand files.
--- A fragment that holds a backtick is never completed: `getcompletion()` would run
--- the span between backticks through the shell, and a pasted line is not to be
--- trusted with that.
---
--- `opts.on_back` makes the prompt one step of a larger flow (`kit.form` with
--- `back = true`): `<BS>` on an EMPTY line, `<S-Tab>` and `<C-p>` close the
--- prompt and call `on_back(line)` -- the line as it stood, so the caller can
--- keep a half-typed answer -- instead of `on_submit`/`on_cancel`. A press of
--- those keys while a completion popup is open still belongs to the popup,
--- and without `on_back` none of the three is touched. A `<BS>` that follows
--- another one of the same prompt by less than 300 ms is a held key repeating,
--- not a new press, and never goes back (see `BS_RUN_MS`): holding it down
--- empties the field and stops there instead of deleting the answers before it.
---
--- `opts.buttons` adds a clickable row of `[ Label ]` buttons under the field
--- (`{ { id = "back"|"skip"|"submit", label = "..." }, ... }`; `submit` is
--- `<CR>`, `skip` is `<Esc>`, `back` is the `on_back` keys, and a `back` button
--- is dropped when there is no `on_back`). `<Down>` (and `<Tab>`, unless
--- `completion` owns it) moves the focus from the field onto the row, starting
--- on the `submit` button; there `h`/`l`/arrows/`<Tab>`/`<S-Tab>` move it,
--- `<CR>` presses the focused button, `<Esc>` still cancels and `<Up>`/`k`/`i`/
--- `a` return to the field. A left click on a button focuses *and* presses it
--- in one action, exactly as in `kit.confirm`. The row's layout, focus
--- highlight and hit-test are `ui.kit.buttons`, shared with `kit.confirm`.
--- The row is line 2 of the buffer, so it is kept honest: it is laid out again,
--- shifted, when a long answer scrolls the window sideways (every line goes
--- with it), and a paste or `<C-j>` that splits the field into several lines
--- is joined back into one with a space, the row put back under it.

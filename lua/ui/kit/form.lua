---@module 'ui.kit.form'
--- Form component: a sequential multi-field prompt — one `kit.input` per
--- field, chained field-by-field into a single keyed result table. This is
--- the "several `vim.fn.input`/`vim.ui.input` calls in a row, each optional
--- with its own default" pattern that got hand-rolled independently (e.g.
--- sandbox.nvim's `container_commands.lua` chaining Image/Name/Ports/Volumes/
--- Env prompts by hand, buffer_ctx.nvim's own `boilerplate/templates/utils.lua`
--- `process_prompts` helper).
---
--- Field contract: `{ name, label|prompt, default?, required?, expand_env?,
--- theme?, width?, relative? }`. `name` is the key the field's answer is
--- stored under in the result table handed to `on_submit`.
---
--- `<Esc>` on a field:
---   - `required = true`  -> aborts the whole form; `on_cancel` fires, no
---     further fields are shown (matches sandbox.nvim's Image field: the one
---     mandatory field in that chain, where Esc really means "abort").
---   - otherwise (default) -> skips the field (its value becomes `default`
---     or `""`) and the form continues to the next field (matches
---     sandbox.nvim's Name/Ports/Volumes/Env fields: Esc = "leave this one
---     blank", not "cancel everything").
---
--- `opts.back = true` (opt-in; without it the form behaves exactly as above)
--- lets the user walk back through the chain to fix an earlier answer:
---   - from field `i > 1`, `<BS>` on an EMPTY field, `<S-Tab>` or `<C-p>` (or
---     the `[← Back]` button) reopens field `i - 1` with its previous answer
---     as the editable text, so only the correction has to be typed. The first
---     field has no back (unless `opts.on_back` is given, see below).
---   - answers survive the round trip in both directions: what was typed in
---     the field being left is kept as that field's text for when the user
---     comes back to it, so going back and forth loses nothing.
---   - the title carries a step indicator, "Label (2/5)" (left out for a
---     one-field form).
---   - a clickable row sits under the field: `[← Back]` (not on the first
---     field), `[Skip]` (not on a `required` one: it is `<Esc>`) and
---     `[Next ↵]` (`[Done ↵]` on the last field: it is `<CR>`). `<Down>` or
---     `<Tab>` moves the focus onto it; see `ui.kit.input` for its keys.
--- `<Esc>` keeps its meaning on every field, back-navigated to or not.
---
--- `opts.on_back(values)` (opt-in, only with `back = true`) gives the first field
--- a back as well, for a form that is itself one step of a longer flow: the
--- same keys and the `[← Back]` button close the form and call `on_back` with the
--- answers so far -- the first field's text as it stood included, and the ones
--- the user had typed further on and walked back from -- so the caller can open
--- whatever comes before it and, coming forward again, reopen the form with those
--- answers as `default`s. Neither `on_submit` nor `on_cancel` fires then.

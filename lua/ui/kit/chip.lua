---@module 'ui.kit.chip'
--- Persistent, editor-corner status chip. Unlike `kit.toast` (auto-dismissing,
--- stacks, one-shot), a chip is mounted once under a stable `id` and stays on
--- screen -- updated in place -- until the consumer unmounts it or its own
--- `text`/`visible` says there is nothing to show right now. Built for a
--- plugin's own always-on indicator (an active session name, an ambient
--- container count, ...) that today only gets a one-shot `vim.notify` toast
--- nobody remembers five seconds later.
---
--- `mount(opts)` registers (or re-configures, if `opts.id` already exists) a
--- chip and draws it once. From then on the consumer calls `refresh(id)`
--- whenever its own state changed -- there is no polling timer here, same
--- reasoning `ui.context` gives for driving its overlay off events rather
--- than a clock: a boolean/string read on every keystroke would cost nothing,
--- but nothing here needs to be *that* fresh, and a timer is one more thing
--- to leak.
---
--- `text`/`visible` may be a plain value or a zero-arg function, re-read on
--- every `refresh`. An empty resolved text hides the chip even when
--- `visible` (or its default) says otherwise -- mirrors the "return '' when
--- there's nothing to show" convention `sessions.statusline.component()`
--- already uses, so wiring one straight into `text` just works.
---
--- `text` may embed `\n` to stack several lines in one box (casedesk.nvim's
--- case pin does this for "case number, title on the line below") -- the
--- box's height follows the line count, and its width follows the widest
--- line, not a fixed one-row assumption.
---
--- Colour has two independent modes, both accepted as `opts.color`: a
--- highlight-group name (its `fg` is tinted into the window background --
--- `CHIP_TINT`, the same mix `ui.context`'s chip style uses, so it reads as
--- the same family and re-tints itself on `ColorScheme`), or an explicit
--- `{ fg, bg }` pair (`"#rrggbb"` strings or 24-bit numbers) that stays fixed
--- across colorschemes. `nil` uses `DEFAULT_HL_GROUP` ("Special"). `color`
--- may also be a zero-arg function returning either shape, re-called fresh
--- on every `refresh` (same as `text`/`visible`) -- for a colour with no
--- single stable source, e.g. a host statusline that switches *which*
--- highlight group it references as the mode changes rather than one group
--- whose own colour changes. Pair with `opts.track_mode = true` so the chip
--- actually repaints *when* the mode changes, not just at the next
--- incidental `refresh()`.
---
--- Each mounted chip gets its own highlight group (`UiKitChip_<id>`) rather
--- than the shared `Kit*` groups `ui.kit.theme` materializes -- several
--- chips, or a chip and a modal kit popup, can be on screen at once with
--- independently coloured chips instead of fighting over one shared group.
---
--- `opts.shape` picks the box, from the shared vocabulary in
--- `ui.kit.presets`
--- (also used by `ui.context`, `ui.tabline`,
--- `ui.statusline` and third-party consumers like
--- sessions.nvim/casedesk.nvim): `"rounded_chip"` (the default, a bordered
--- capsule), `"chip"` (borderless, a flat coloured block), or `"classic"`
--- (borderless AND background-less -- just the coloured text floating over
--- whatever is behind it, no box at all; any `color.bg` is ignored for this
--- one since the whole point is having no visible background). The old
--- names (`"rounded"`/`"rect"`/`"text"`) still work, normalized on the way
--- in -- see
--- `ui.kit.presets.normalize()`.
---
--- A floating window belongs to the tabpage it was opened in and simply does
--- not appear on any other tab -- so a chip that should follow the user
--- across tabs is re-opened (same text/colour) on `TabEnter` rather than
--- moved; see `ensure_current_tab`.

  --   pulse is pending (e.g. a hide/show cycle) -- the captured handle can
  --   never match again, so the revert silently never happens.
  -- * A per-entry generation counter ALONE (a later version of this) fixes
  --   that, but `M.unmount(id)` followed by `M.mount(id, ...)` for the same
  --   id allocates a brand-new `entry` table whose own counter restarts
  --   from scratch -- so a still-pending revert from a pulse on the OLD,
  --   now-orphaned entry can land on generation 1 of the NEW entry's own
  --   first pulse purely by numeric coincidence, cutting it short. The old
  --   entry's pending timer was never cancelled by unmount() either, so it
  --   still fires.
  --
  -- Capturing the entry TABLE itself (not just its id) and requiring
  -- `chips[id] == target` closes that gap: after unmount()+mount(), the new
  -- entry is a different table, so a stale callback from the old one no
  -- longer matches regardless of what its generation counter reads. The
  -- generation counter (same shape as sessions.nvim's own `hide_generation`,
  -- sessions/chip.lua) still does its own job for two overlapping pulses on
  -- the SAME entry (window replaced or not) -- entry identity alone can't

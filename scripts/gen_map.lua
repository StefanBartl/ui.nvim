---   nvim --headless -l scripts/gen_map.lua                    # regenerate
---   nvim --headless -l scripts/gen_map.lua --check            # verify, write nothing
---   nvim --headless -l scripts/gen_map.lua --check --lenient  # fail on staleness only
---   nvim --headless -l scripts/gen_map.lua --full             # + LuaLS enrichment
---
--- Everything above the options table is copied verbatim from
--- documentation.nvim's `scripts/gen_map.lua`; see its docs/REUSE.md.
---
--- `docs/map/` is gitignored, so `--check` is deliberately NOT run in CI: it
--- compares the freshly generated map against the files on disk, and on a
--- fresh checkout there are none -- the comparison would then fail on every
--- run regardless of the actual state of the code.

--- Put a dependency on the runtimepath, if it is not already reachable.
---
--- A headless `nvim -l` run starts with no plugin manager, so nothing beyond
--- `root` is on the rtp -- `documentation` and `lib.nvim` both have to be
--- found by hand. Three candidates, in descending order of explicitness: an
--- environment variable (what CI sets), a `.deps/` checkout (what CI clones
--- into), and a sibling checkout (what a local development tree looks like).
---@param modname string A module the dependency provides, used as the probe.
---@param dirname string Repository directory name.
